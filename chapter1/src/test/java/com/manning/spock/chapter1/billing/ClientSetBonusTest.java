Here are the test scenarios for the `setBonus` method:
**Scenario 1: Setting Bonus to True**
Details:
  TestName: setBonusToTrue
  Description: Verifies that the `bonus` field is set to `true` when the `setBonus` method is called with `true` as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setBonus` method.
  Act: Call the `setBonus` method with `true` as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the `bonus` field is `true`.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `bonus` field is updated correctly when the `setBonus` method is called with `true`. This test ensures that the method sets the bonus flag correctly, which is essential for the application's business logic.
**Scenario 2: Setting Bonus to False**
Details:
  TestName: setBonusToFalse
  Description: Verifies that the `bonus` field is set to `false` when the `setBonus` method is called with `false` as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setBonus` method.
  Act: Call the `setBonus` method with `false` as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the `bonus` field is `false`.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `bonus` field is updated correctly when the `setBonus` method is called with `false`. This test ensures that the method sets the bonus flag correctly, which is essential for the application's business logic.
**Scenario 3: Setting Bonus to Null**
Details:
  TestName: setBonusToNull
  Description: Verifies that the `bonus` field is not set to `null` when the `setBonus` method is called with `null` as a parameter (not applicable in this case since the parameter is a primitive boolean).
Execution:
  Not applicable, as the method parameter is a primitive boolean and cannot be null.
Validation:
  N/A
**Scenario 4: Multiple Calls to Set Bonus**
Details:
  TestName: setBonusMultipleTimes
  Description: Verifies that the `bonus` field is updated correctly when the `setBonus` method is called multiple times with different values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class containing the `setBonus` method.
  Act: Call the `setBonus` method with `true` as a parameter, then call it again with `false` as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the `bonus` field is updated correctly after each call.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the `bonus` field is updated correctly when the `setBonus` method is called multiple times. This test ensures that the method behaves correctly even when called repeatedly, which is essential for the application's business logic.
These test scenarios cover the basic functionality of the `setBonus` method, including setting the bonus flag to `true` and `false`, and handling multiple calls to the method.
