Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the `charge` method:
**Scenario 1: Charging with amount greater than 100**
Details:
  TestName: chargeAmountGreaterThan100
  Description: Verify that the client's bonus is set to true when charging with an amount greater than 100.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Client object and set its bonus to false.
  Act: Call the `charge` method with the client and an amount of 150.
  Assert: Assert that the client's bonus is true.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `charge` method correctly sets the client's bonus to true when the charged amount exceeds 100. This is a critical business logic aspect, as it determines when a client is eligible for a bonus.
**Scenario 2: Charging with amount less than or equal to 100**
Details:
  TestName: chargeAmountLessThanOrEqualTo100
  Description: Verify that the client's bonus is not set when charging with an amount less than or equal to 100.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Client object and set its bonus to false.
  Act: Call the `charge` method with the client and an amount of 50.
  Assert: Assert that the client's bonus is still false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `charge` method does not set the client's bonus when the charged amount is within the normal range (less than or equal to 100).
**Scenario 3: Charging with zero amount**
Details:
  TestName: chargeZeroAmount
  Description: Verify that the client's bonus is not set when charging with an amount of zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Client object and set its bonus to false.
  Act: Call the `charge` method with the client and an amount of 0.
  Assert: Assert that the client's bonus is still false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `charge` method handles the edge case of a zero amount correctly, without setting the client's bonus.
**Scenario 4: Charging with negative amount**
Details:
  TestName: chargeNegativeAmount
  Description: Verify that the client's bonus is not set when charging with a negative amount.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new Client object and set its bonus to false.
  Act: Call the `charge` method with the client and an amount of -50.
  Assert: Assert that the client's bonus is still false.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `charge` method handles the edge case of a negative amount correctly, without setting the client's bonus.
**Scenario 5: Charging with null client**
Details:
  TestName: chargeNullClient
  Description: Verify that the `charge` method throws a NullPointerException when called with a null client.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a null Client object.
  Act: Call the `charge` method with the null client and an amount of 150.
  Assert: Assert that a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the `charge` method correctly handles the edge case of a null client, throwing an exception to prevent unexpected behavior.
